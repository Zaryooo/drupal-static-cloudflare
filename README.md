```
**Note**: We are adding `"drupal/tome": "^1.11"` module and then applying a patch for it 
```json
"drupal/tome": {
    "Tome not working with Drush 12": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2023-08-02/tome_drush12-support.patch"
}
```
## Note:
* if you come back after some days - just start the codespaces again, go to the `drupal_site` folder, run `drush serve` again and in the `ports` tab follow the link to access your site 

* NOTE: if "drush" doesn't work - use "vendor/bin/drush" instead. Example: `vendor/bin/drush serve` (inside the drupal_site folder).
